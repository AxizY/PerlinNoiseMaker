# Perlin Noise Maker

## Synopsis

This is an HTML5 app for creating Perlin noise images.

## Motivation

I created this as a means to provide more user control over generating Perlin noise than is typically found in most image editing software packages (such as Photoshop's Render Clouds feature).  Perlin noise can also be used as a basis for textures in video games.
